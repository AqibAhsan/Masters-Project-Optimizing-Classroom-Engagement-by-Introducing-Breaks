The impact of breaks on student concentration through a simulation model. 
The model is based on previous research where students transition between concentration and distraction states, with breaks introduced when 50% of students are concentrating. Break timing is determined by exponential distribution intervals, and break duration is calculated using rates for concentration levels above and below 50%.

The simulation was modified to account for different distraction levelsâ€”either a single level or multiple levels (low, medium, and high). For both cases, simulations were run for class sizes ranging from 10 to 100 students.

Key findings:
Breaks significantly improve the probability of students concentrating, particularly in smaller class sizes (10 students), and continue to show benefits in larger classes.
The study provides insights for educators on optimal break timing and duration to enhance focus.

In conclusion, breaks, when strategically timed, can effectively increase student concentration, especially in small class settings. The study offers valuable guidance on planning breaks in educational environments.
